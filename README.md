## Introduction
Let's continue to dig into the subject of Front-end Web performances and push techniques and studies towards new areas of improvement.

After studying in the [previous article](https://itnext.io/is-it-possible-to-improve-javascript-jit-with-an-aot-pre-step-8e25ecb3590f) the possibility of adding an AOT (Ahead Of Time) pre-step to JavaScript JIT (Just In Time) and we discovered two optimistic solutions: this study Augmenting JavaScript JIT with Ahead-of-Time Compiling and the use of WebAssembly.

We have also seen that the most time-consuming step in JavaScript execution is the optimization phase: types, hot functions, paths, etc. In addition, to trigger this phase, the JavaScript code must be executed several times. I'm looking for a solution to pre-optimize JavaScript code before execution.Â 

We also saw that using Typescript has no effect on optimization, hence I will try to find some naturally typed languages.

Therefore, in this article, I will explore alternatives to JavaScript for building a front-end web application, including Reason ML, ELM, Haskell Miso, Python Flask and Rust Yew.

## Benchmark Execution Plan
The screens of the application that we are going to develop are as follows:

This small application highlights the main techniques we use on a daily basis in the Web Front-end:

ðŸ”¸Call of a Rest API (retrieval of the list of news and details of a news).

ðŸ”¸Display of a list with pagination.

ðŸ”¸Routing from one page to another.

ðŸ”¸Change of "state" to note and comment on a news item.

The reference application will be developed using:

ðŸ”¸ React JS

ðŸ”¸ JavaScript (ES6)

ðŸ”¸ Redux

ðŸ”¸Eslint with the Airbnb configuration

ðŸ”¸Jest and React Testing Library

ðŸ”¸Webpack

This looks like the stack I'm currently using.

I want to see how performance is handled:

ðŸ”¸ is there a mechanism like "Suspense" and "lazy"?

ðŸ”¸ and like "useMemo" and "useCallback".

ðŸ”¸ is it possible to split the bundle?

ðŸ”¸ or there are other optimization mechanismsÂ ?

I want to highlight:

ðŸ”¸ the difficulty of setting up.

ðŸ”¸ the learning curve of language and its techniques.

ðŸ”¸ compilation/transpilation time in DEV and PROD modes.

ðŸ”¸ documentation.

ðŸ”¸ runtime performance.

I'm going to take a closer look at these languages and frameworks:

ðŸ”¸Reason ML

ðŸ”¸ELM

ðŸ”¸Haskell Miso

ðŸ”¸Python Flask

ðŸ”¸Rust Yew

Benchmark metrics
I will exploit Core Web Vitals collected from Chrome DevTools:

ðŸ”¹Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) for measuring the loading speed

ðŸ”¹First Input Delay (FID) for scoring interactivity

ðŸ”¹Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) for calculating the visual stability

With that, I will also be interested in the size of the bundle in PROD.

It's going to be a great study, here we goÂ !
